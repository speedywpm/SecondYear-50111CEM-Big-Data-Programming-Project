NOTES TO THE /assessment FOLDER
MAIN FILE IS MemorySaving.m
PLEASE PUT THE DATA FILE TO TEST INSIDE THE SAME FOLDER (File path is specified in MemorySaving.m file)
Right now it is set to process 1000 data 5 hours, max processors: 8
If you want to change that do that in SequentialProcessing.m and ParallelProcessing.m also in ParallelLoop.m

Matlab code for 5011CEM 20/21

The repository contains the code files for 5011CEM delivered in semester 2, starting January 2022.

This module is delivered using flipped learning. This means that there are recorded 'lectures' providing the overview of the learning material. There are then tasks which shold be completed. This repository contains the Matlab code used for these tasks.
The scheduled teaching slots with tutors are to be run as tutorial sessions. You should arrive at these sessions having completed your tasks as well as you can, and use these sessions for additional learning around the topics

Each folder contains code for a separate task, numbered by teaching session.
The folder 'Common Files' contains code that is common between sessions.
The folder 'Model' is empty at this time. you will be provided with 3 data files separately to download and save to this location.

It is recommended that you retain the folder structure, and add all the folders to your Matlab path. the easiest way to do this is to select the top levbel folder, right click and select 'add to path' -> selected folders and subfolders.
